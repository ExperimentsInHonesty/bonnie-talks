# Hack for LA Kanban Guide
A guide we share with people during onboarding that helps them understand why we use a Kanban framework instead of Scrum and an introduction to how its all setup<br>

The guide is a work in progress, and you will see that its open for anyone to comment on it, so that we can continue to improve it.
