# Points System
We have been moving away from t-shirt size labels to a standardized point system, so that we can create automated metrics.

| label        | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| size: 0.25pt | Can be done in 1.5 hours or less        |
| size: 0.5pt  | Can be done in 2-3 hours or less        |
| size: 1pt    | Can be done in 4-6 hours                |
| size: 2pt    | Can be done in 7-12 hours               |
| size: 3pt    | Can be done in 13-18 hours              |
| size: 5pt    | Can be done in 19-30 hours              |
| size: 8pt    | Can be done in 31-48 hours              |
| size: 13+pt  | Must be broken down into smaller issues |

We are in the process of building an open source story points calculator browser extension that uses those point labels.
